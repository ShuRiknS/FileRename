# FileRename
A Python Script which will rename multiple files in the same directory/folder with a part of the file name being common and having an incrementing number at the end. 
Suppose a file has multiple images with random names and they should be renamed in a specific manner, say img1.jpg, img2.jpg, img3.jpg and so on. The script can be used to rename all the files in that specific folder in the same manner.
